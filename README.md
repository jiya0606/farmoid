Farmoid's goal is to increase yield and decrease water wastage of the industry’s disadvantaged: small farmers. Farmoid places one-two sensors per 300 square feet (depending on the farm layout) and collects moisture, nutrient, and temperature readings to provide farmers with feedback. We hope that Farmoid can aid struggling small farmers across the United States and hopefully somewhat stabilize the global food supply.
